                <h3>Our Story</h3>
                <p>The Broke Gamers is the brainchild of five lifelong friends who bonded over their love for gaming and
                    technology. Growing up, we often found ourselves gaming on low-end 'potato PCs' due to financial
                    constraints. These experiences inspired us to create a company dedicated to providing affordable
                    gaming solutions to others facing similar challenges. Our journey from modest beginnings to
                    launching this venture has fueled our commitment to making gaming accessible to all.</p>

                <h3>Our Mission and Vision</h3>
                <p>Our mission is to offer cost-effective gaming solutions by providing high-quality refurbished
                    components and custom-built gaming PCs. We aim to build trust within the gaming community through exceptional
                    value, rigorous quality assurance, and outstanding customer service. Our vision is to be the go-to
                    destination for budget-conscious gamers seeking reliable and affordable gaming options.</p>
